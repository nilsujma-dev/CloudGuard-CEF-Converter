CEF:0|Check Point|CloudGuard||Minimize access to create pods (RBAC)|Minimize access to create pods (RBAC)|Low|msg=The ability to create pods in a namespace can provide a number of opportunities for privilege escalation, such as assigning privileged service accounts to these pods or mounting hostPaths with access to sensitive data (unless Pod Security Policies are implemented to restrict this access). As such, access to create new pods should be restricted to the smallest possible group of users. The ability to create pods in a cluster opens up possibilities for privilege escalation and should be restricted, where possible. suser=system:openshift:openshift-apiserver suid=a3daded0-2567-4bf6-b175-595f50ac49c1 rt=1686308431000 fname=CLOUD-011 Check Point CloudGuard Compliance Alert-24Hrs outcome=Failed cs1=Where possible, remove create access to pod objects in the cluster. cs1Label=Rule Remediation cs2=Global cs2Label=Region cs3=/8JcT1at9PWIykouwAxjYQ cs3Label=Finding Key cs4=D9.K8S.IAM.35 cs4Label=Rule ID flexString1={"id": "5af13ab5-72ed-43b6-9544-33c9236d62f0", "name": "nu-openshift-cluster", "vendor": "Kubernetes", "dome9CloudAccountId": "5af13ab5-72ed-43b6-9544-33c9236d62f0", "organizationalUnitId": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000", "organizationalUnitPath": ""} flexString1Label=Account
